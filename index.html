<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M1BcYmNA27k/maxresdefault.jpg" height="400" width="600" alt="S'mores Cookie Cups">

<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<ul>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</ul>
<ul>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup unsalted butter</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup light brown sugar</ul>
<ul>1/3 cup granulated sugar</ul>
<ul>1 large egg</ul>
<ul>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
<ul>12 large marshmallows, cut in half</ul>
<ul>2 Hershey's chocolate bars</ul>

<p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
<ol>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</ol>
<ol>2. In a large bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</ol>
<ol>3. In another bowl, beat the butter and sugars together until creamy and smooth. Add in the egg and vanilla extract and 
    mix until combined. Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix until combined.
</ol>
<ol>4. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough into a greased mini muffin tin. Press dough down into the muffin tin using 
    a spoon or something round so there is a small indent in the dough. Bake for 6-8 minutes or until edges are just
    golden brown. Remove from oven and gently press a half marshmallow, sticky side down, onto each cookie. Let
    cool completely.
</ol>
<ol>5. Once cooled, preheat broiler. Place cookies under the broiler for 1-2 minutes, keeping a close eye on
    them so they dont burn. Once marshmallows are golden brown, remove from oven and place a piece of chocolate
    on top of each cookie.
